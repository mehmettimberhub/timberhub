## The Scenario / Ideation
    - This is a simple CRUD application for a wood distributing company.
    - The app is built CRUD operations for products and productVariations for IT and an API.
    - The purpose of this app is to prove that the 20 rules of development listed here works: https://www.notion.so/timberhub/Tech-excellence-brainstorming-ef7a1ac715714de8bea9eaa725bb663a#ded869868ce043f097a069184617bd96.
    - The app is built with the idea of having a monolith and an API. The monolith is built with Laravel and Livewire. The API is built with Laravel and Sanctum.
    - In the app the consuming logic (Livewire/API) is separated from the business logic (Services/Repositories).
    - The idea of having this much layer for a simple application is overkill, but the idea is to show that the application is scalable and can be extended easily.
   
CHEERS!
